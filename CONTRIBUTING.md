# Contributing to so4-oracle

Thanks for helping build SO4 Markets. This guide covers how to set up the project, where things live, and how to get your changes merged.

---

## Setup

**Prerequisites**

- Rust stable (install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs))
- Optional: `cargo-watch` for hot-reloading during development (`cargo install cargo-watch`)

**Clone and build**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:SO4-Markets/so4-oracle.git
cd so4-oracle

# Build all workspace crates
cargo build --workspace

# Type-check without building artifacts
cargo check --workspace

# Run all tests
cargo test --workspace
```

**Environment variables**

Key variables (see `oracle/src/config.rs` for the full list):

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `PRICE_FEED_CONFIG` | JSON array of `TokenConfig` entries (see `config/tokens.json` for the schema) |
| `STELLAR_RPC_URL` | Soroban RPC endpoint |
| `HORIZON_URL` | Stellar Horizon endpoint |
| `NETWORK_PASSPHRASE` | `Test SDF Network ; September 2015` (testnet) or mainnet equivalent |
| `KEEPER_SECRET_KEY` | Stellar secret key for the keeper account |
| `ORACLE_CONTRACT_ID` | Deployed oracle contract address |
| `ADMIN_API_TOKEN` | Bearer token for admin routes (`/oracle/status`, `/metrics`, etc.) |

**Run locally**

```bash
cargo run -p oracle
# → listening on 0.0.0.0:3000 (or whatever BIND_ADDR is set to)
```

Watch mode (rebuilds on save):

```bash
cargo watch -x "run -p oracle"
```

```

There is **no** Cloudflare Worker, `wrangler.toml`, or `apis/` crate in this repository. The oracle is a plain Axum binary deployed via Docker (see `Dockerfile`) on Fly.io / Railway (see `fly.toml`, `railway.json`).

## HTTP API

Once running, the oracle exposes:

| Route | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /health` | None | Always returns `{"status":"ok"}` — liveness probe |
| `GET /ready` | None | Returns 200 only when price cache is warm and loops are not stale |
| `GET /prices` | None | Current cached prices for all configured tokens |
| `GET /metrics` | Bearer | Cycle counts and latency gauges |
| `GET /oracle/status` | Bearer | Price cache + cycle status |
| `GET /keeper/status` | Bearer | Pending keeper operations + recent executions |
| `GET /keeper/balance` | Bearer | Current keeper account XLM balance |
| `GET /oracle/failed-submissions` | Bearer | Ring buffer of failed on-chain submissions |

## Finding Work

All open issues are tracked on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/SO4-Markets/so4-oracle/issues). Issues are labelled:

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `good first issue` | Self-contained, well-defined, good starting point |
| `bug` | Something is broken |
| `documentation` | Docs, comments, diagrams |
| `enhancement` | New feature or improvement |
| `infrastructure` | CI, Docker, deploy scripts, tooling |

Before starting, leave a comment on the issue so no one duplicates effort.

## Workflow

1. **Fork** the repo (external contributors) or create a branch (team members).
2. Branch naming: `feat/short-description`, `fix/short-description`, `test/short-description`.
3. Make your changes. Keep commits focused — one logical change per commit.
4. **Run checks locally** before opening a PR:
   ```bash
   cargo fmt --all
   cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
   cargo test --workspace
   ```
5. Open a PR against `main`. Fill in the PR template.
6. Request a review from a maintainer.

## Working with Coding Agents

If you are using an autonomous coding agent (or if you are an agent), you must read and strictly follow the [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) contract. It contains the mandatory verification gate commands and specific repository traps you must be aware of to avoid breaking the build.

---

## Pull Request Guidelines

- **Title:** Start with a type prefix: `feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `chore:`.
- **Description:** What does this do, and why? Link the relevant issue (`Closes #N`).
- **Tests:** New functionality must include tests. Bug fixes should include a regression test.
- **No partial implementations:** If a function is not yet complete, leave it as a stub with `todo!()` rather than committing broken logic.
- **No unnecessary refactors:** Keep PRs focused on the stated issue.

---

## Code Style

- `cargo fmt` is enforced in CI. Run it before pushing.
- `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` must pass. Address all warnings.
- No comments explaining *what* code does — names should do that. Add a comment only when the *why* is non-obvious.
- No emojis in code or commit messages.

---

## Testing

- Unit tests go in the same file: `#[cfg(test)] mod tests { ... }`.
- Integration tests go in `tests/` at the workspace root.
- For HTTP endpoint tests, use `axum::test` or `reqwest` against a spawned server.
